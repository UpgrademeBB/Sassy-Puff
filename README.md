# Sassy-Puff# Sassy Pack

Sassy Pack is a web application that allows users to create an easily clickable shortcut on their mobile device to a certificate for legal use of THC products. It enables users to quickly access certificates and lab results proving the legality of their product, supporting compliance and peace of mind.
